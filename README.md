# Setting Team Expectations
## Customer Communications 🎙
* In all things: timely. Assume always that people will likely be waiting on your response to conduct their work
	* If there are problems with an order or which affect orders (kits without a BOM, parts in wrong org, etc.), look at the Customer Need By Date of the order first and determine the urgency of the matter
* For responding to tickets:
	1. What appears to be the issue
	2. What you are doing about it
	3. What—if anything—they have to do for you (i.e. provide more info or example(s), re-run a process while you log/monitor it, etc.)
	4. What are the next steps
* It’s nice to follow up after you completed the work (e.g. _“You all good to go? Anything else you need?”)_
	* Walk around and see people face-to-face
	* If you can’t see them face-to-face, send a quick email
* For responding to requests (e.g. _“Can Salesforce|Oracle do this…?”, “Can you help me run a report for…”_):
	1. Express willingness to help
	2. What other priorities you have
	3. "I will look into it and get back to you."
		* __Don’t provide a timeline even if it will only take a moment… because sometimes shit blows up and you have to adjust to fight new fires__
* For when things go really wrong:
	1. Follow [Seth Godin's list](http://www.sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/12/when-things-go-wrong.html), skipping **no** steps in the process

## Deadlines 💀 
* If I set deadlines, it’s for a reason. If you don’t know the reason, ask
* Communication is key
	* You will not be in trouble for missing a deadline if there’s good reason
	* If things slip, I need to be able to explain to my management why
* Continuously missing deadlines, however, is not okay; it means we’re doing something wrong
	* Incorrect estimates upfront on time-to-complete
	* Mismanagement of current task load
	* Not putting the correct people in the right place to succeed

## Career Development 🔧
_“I don't want storm troopers, I want Jedi”_ - Jason Calacanis

* I expect you to keep learning and _stay relevant_
	* What are the new trends in the industry? New products? Features and functions other organizations use which we could adopt?
* What you will get from me:
	* A focus on your career development, here at ADS or even elsewhere
	* Opportunities for growth whenever possible
* What I need from you:
	* Commitment to plan
	* Overall flexibility 
	* Be proactive in your own development
